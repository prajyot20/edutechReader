<p><br />WE DO MAKE USE OF MUPDF LIBRARY FOR READING PLATFORM.</p>
<p>MUPDF is a free and open-source software (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software) framework (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Framework_(software)) written in C (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)) that implements a PDF (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Document_Format) , XPS (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_XML_Paper_Specification) , and EPUB (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPUB) parsing and rendering engine. It is used primarily to render pages (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rendering_(computer_graphics)) into bitmaps (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitmap) , but also provides support for other operations such as searching and listing the table of contents and hyperlinks.</p>
<p>The focus of MuPDF is on speed, small code size, and high-quality anti-aliased rendering. Since the 1.2 release, MuPDF has optional support for interactive features such as form filling, JavaScript (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) and transitions.[1] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MuPDF#cite_note-MuPDF_News_page-1)</p>
<p>The library ships with a rudimentary X11 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X11) and Windows viewer, and a set of command-line tools for batch rendering (mutool draw), examining the file structure (mutool show), and rewriting files (mutool clean). Later versions also have a Javascript interpreter (mutool run) that allows for running scripts to create and edit PDF files.</p>
<p>A number of free software applications use MuPDF to render PDF documents, the most notable being Sumatra PDF (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumatra_PDF) . MuPDF is also available as a package for most Unix-like (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix-like) operating system distributions.</p>
